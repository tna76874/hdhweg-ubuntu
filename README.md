# ubuntu homeschooling configuration

## Aim

Sometimes there are PCs/Notebooks available but without an up-to-date operating system. The aim of this notebook is to find the balance between data protection and a â€œsomehow managed" device running a free-of-charge open-source system.  With this playbook an Ubuntu system can be configured to the basic needs of homeschooling.

This repository is the counterpart to the [homeschooling server stack](https://github.com/tna76874/hdhweg-homeschooling-stack), that allows to easily set up a server with different collaborative open-source tools.

## Usb-installation-stick

First download a fresh [Ubuntu image](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.4/ubuntu-18.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso). Then you proceed to create a bootable usb-installation-stick:

[Tutorial for Mac](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#3-prepare-the-usb-stick) 

[Tutorial for Windows](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows?_ga=2.155856051.944099286.1569325450-264943242.1569325450#2-requirements) 

If you have prepared your installation-stick, you [install](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop#4-boot-from-usb-flash-drive) Ubuntu on the PC/Notebook.

## Installation

When everything is done, you log into your Ubuntu account and open a terminal (shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T). Copy the whole content of the box beneath, paste it into the console and press enter. This will download the setup-skript and install all [basic packages](roles/setup/tasks/apt.yml) including firewall configurations. For this setup you must enter again your password in the console - don't be confused that there is not shown anything when typing.

```bash
wget -qO setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tna76874/hdhweg-ubuntu/master/setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh && sudo bash setup.sh && rm setup.sh
```

**or**

when you want to install [additional software packages](roles/custom/tasks/main.yml):

```bash
wget -qO setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tna76874/hdhweg-ubuntu/master/setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh && sudo bash setup.sh custom.yml && rm setup.sh
```

#### Custom commands

With this configuration a few custom console commands are defined. These will be initialized within the .bashrc of every user. Check the details [here](roles/base/templates/wegrc.j2) .

#### Automatic pulls

By default automatic pulls from this git repository gets triggered 10 minutes after each system startup. To switch off this feature, type in terminal:

```bash
sudo git -C /root/hdhweg-ubuntu pull && sudo ansible-playbook /root/hdhweg-ubuntu/autoupdate.yml --tags disable
```

#### Extra: TeamSpeak

If you want, you can also install TeamSpeak. Type in a terminal after the setup playbook completed:

```bash
/srv/install_ts.sh
```

If you want to prepare a Ubuntu image you can also install TeamSpeak into /srv.

```bash
sudo /srv/install_ts.sh /srv
```

## Updates and maintenance

With this setup two cronjobs will be installed. One gets triggered 10 minutes after every startup and updates the git-repository containing the playbooks. The second runs the `main.yml` playbook 15 minutes after every startup and all packages gets updated. Please check the content of [main.yml](roles/custom/tasks/main.yml) carefully and disable automatic pulls (described above) if you do not want this role to be kept up to date with this repository. **Disabling automatic pulls is recommended if you have experience with linux systems!**  In any case, every other role except `main.yml` have to be triggered manually. To pull and install the latest software of this repository you have just to type in the terminal and confirm with your password:

```bash
update
```

The update process for the bigger software bundle gets tiggered with `bigupdate`. Please note, that already installed software gets updated automatically in any case (by `main.yml`). **15 Minutes after the system starts up installed software gets downloaded and updated. Sometimes this can be quite much traffic, so ensure to have a suitable internet connection.**

>**TL;DR**  --> You don't have to do anything to keep your system safe. Install new software simply by typing `update` or `bigupdate` in a terminal and ensure a suitable internet connection.



## Documentation of hardware components

Sometimes it is mandatory to document the hardware components of the system. For this purpose you can generate a pdf file with a short overview of the components with the tool `inxi`. You find the document in the downloads folder.

```bash
hwpdf
```

If it is mandatory to wipe the harddrive, you can use another function. With this command, you first select a harddrive to wipe (e.g. sda) and the wipe process will be added to the overview of the system components. This command can only be executed from within a ubuntu-live system (username "ubuntu").

```bash
shreddrive
```

## Preparing a custom installation image

If you have multiple devices to set up with this configuration, it might be handy to prepare a custom preconfigured Ubuntu image. If you use a ubuntu operating system, one way to do this is to use [Cubic](https://launchpad.net/cubic) ([Example](https://askubuntu.com/questions/741753/how-to-use-cubic-to-create-a-custom-ubuntu-live-cd-image)). In the big software bundle `cubic` is already included.

```bash
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:cubic-wizard/release
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cubic
```

Once loaded the original [Ubuntu image](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.4/ubuntu-18.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso) into Cubic, you will be logged into a root console. Proceed with the installation process of the ansible playbook and further customize the image to your needs. When finnished, you create a boot-installation-stick with your custom image.

There might be problems with the DNS of the chroot environment of cubic running on ubuntu 18.04. As a workaround you can try:

```bash
mkdir /run/systemd/resolve/
echo "nameserver 127.0.0.53
search network" | tee /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf
ln -sr /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf
```



## Miscellaneous

#### TeamViewer

By default TeamViewer gets installed. Every time the playbook runs (e.g. 15 min after startup) it will be ensured, that the TeamViewer daemon ist **disabled**! So if you start TeamViewer there will be reported "a problem with your internet connection". Actually it is just the switched-off daemon.

If TeamViewer is needed, you have to enable the daemon manually by typing in the terminal:

```bash
sudo killall /opt/teamviewer/tv_bin/TeamViewer; sudo teamviewer daemon enable
```

An alias for this command is `twstart`.
