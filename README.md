# ubuntu homeschooling configuration

### Aim

Sometimes there are PCs/Notebooks available but without an up-to-date operating system. The aim of this notebook is to find the balance between data protection and a â€œsomehow managed" device running a free-of-charge open-source system.  With this playbook an Ubuntu system can be configured to the basic needs of homeschooling.

This repository is the counterpart to the [homeschooling server stack](https://github.com/tna76874/hdhweg-homeschooling-stack), that allows to easily set up a server with different collaborative open-source tools.

### Usb-installation-stick

First download a fresh [Ubuntu image](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.4/ubuntu-18.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso). Then you proceed to create a bootable usb-installation-stick:

[Tutorial for Mac](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#3-prepare-the-usb-stick) 

[Tutorial for Windows](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows?_ga=2.155856051.944099286.1569325450-264943242.1569325450#2-requirements) 

If you have prepared your installation-stick, you [install](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop#4-boot-from-usb-flash-drive) Ubuntu on the PC/Notebook.

### Installation

When everything is done, you log into your Ubuntu account and open a terminal (shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T). Log in as root user and install [basic packages](roles/base/tasks/main.yml).

```bash
$ sudo su
$ cd /root
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common  -y
$ sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install git ansible -y
```

Now you can clone the ansible-playbook and configure your system.

```bash
$ sudo su
$ cd /root
$ git clone https://github.com/tna76874/hdhweg-ubuntu.git
$ cd hdhweg-ubuntu
$ sudo ansible-playbook main.yml
```

### Installing additional software

With a second config file, you can install [additional software](roles/custom/tasks/main.yml).


```bash
$ sudo su
$ cd /root
$ git clone git@github.com:tna76874/hdhweg-ubuntu.git
$ cd hdhweg-ubuntu
$ sudo ansible-playbook custom.yml
```

### Update your system

With this setup a cronjob will be installed that runs the `mail.yml` playbook 15 minutes after every startup. With this, all packages gets updated (no dist-upgrades). If you want to get the latest changes of this git-repository, you have to update the git-repository manually and run the notebook again.

```bash
$ sudo git -C /root/hdhweg-ubuntu pull && sudo ansible-playbook /root/hdhweg-ubuntu/main.yml
```

### Preparing a custom installation image

If you have multiple devices to set up with this configuration, it might be handy to prepare a custom preconfigured Ubuntu image. If you use a ubuntu operating system, one way to do this is to use Cubic.

```bash
$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:cubic-wizard/classic
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install cubic
```

Once loaded the original Ubuntu image into Cubic, you will be logged into a root console. Proceed with the installation process of the ansible playbook and further customize the image to your needs. When finnished, you create a boot-installation-stick with your custom image.
